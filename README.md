# PointCloudViewer
The repo includes my first steps with pointclouds. Since i have recieved my Nvidia TX2, i want to made my own implemenation of the Nvidia-VisionWorks sample. My datasource for the pointcloud is the kinect 2. I used the libfreenect2 library and build a small threaded wrapper arount it, a better cuda based implementation for the point processing is planned.



# HARDWARE PARTS
* Kinect2 + USB3.0 Controller (I tested the MacBookPro2014 USB Controller successfully)

# USED LIBS
* libfreenect2
* sfml
