# PointCloudViewer
The repo includes my first steps with pointclouds. Since i have recieved my Nvidia TX2, i want to made my own implemenation of the Nvidia-VisionWorks sample. As hardware i want to use the KinectV2 (libfreenect2) and some can equipment for advanced data logging.

# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

* 1. opengl framework for pointcloud
* 2. kinect v2 data importer
* 3. obj loader (+texture, shader,..)
* 4. model simple car and road objs
* 5. can data server
* 5.1 selfbuild arduino based speed/gps/ir lidar sensorkit (sketch,schem,stl)
* 6.recording mode
* 7. opencv street sign detection
* 8. caffe integration and training with realtime data
